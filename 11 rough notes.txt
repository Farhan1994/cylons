Recurrent Neural Networks

Time Series Data 
Temperature prediction 

day N?

30   31    30 ......
0     1     2 ........
how far?
Temperature tomorrow -> is it dependent when Caeser defeated Pompeii 60BC?
-> is it dependent on Jurrasic era? 

NEAREST is important 
FURTHER away in time became lesser important
1) present = f(past, present) + bias
	y  = f(x, y) <- recurrent neural network 

ANCIENT history should have been forgotten!!
2) HOW far were you ready to remember?
   present = f(past, present, forget(history) ) + bias 
	y = f(x, y, history) + bias 

Long Short-Term Memory -> Input Gate, Remember Gate, Forget Gate
1) Input Gate: responsible for a f(x) 
2) from this Input Gate, we calculate How much to remember (tanh,sig)
3) the past is multiplied into SIGMOID 


Future = f(PAST) + bias 
y = weights * x + bias  

--------------

historically => owning your servers 

- you will never spill coffee on your server
- a rat will never bite your cables 
- short-circuits?
- fire in the building?
- what if you fire a grudging engineer capabling of doing
all of the above?
- Windows will never update/crash? 

-> what if after buying the servers (256 GB ram, 3.5 GHz processing, 
16 GB of graphics card) -> cluster of 16 machines 

-> you figure out that was wrong config? 

---------------------------------------------
2008-> AMAZON e-commerce website -> on-premise 

Holidays -> they face 8-10x more shopping! > more servers
Normal days-<X or even X/2 shopping! > these servers were wasted 

-> energy required to shut-down and restart is more than consumption
for clusters (because this keeps happening continously)!!! 

------------------------------------
RENT out these servers! -> Elastic Computing->

rent a VIRTUAL SERVER, when you are done using it, just delete! 
This VIRTUAL SERVER was no longer consuming your local resources
but AMAZON's resources locally!

[E-Commerce-> managing inventory!]
AWS founded cloud computing , EMC-> storage (NAS, SAN) 
(Infrastructure as a Service)-> most of the cloud services 
-> this is the majority even today! 
--------------------------------------
[Solutions company]- > architectures

2009 -> Microsoft -> Azure -> if you are not owning the server,
then why bother about the hardware compoents at all?
-> WEb Role (front end) and Worker Role (backend + db) 
-> no infra requirements at all! 
(Platform as a service) -> forget infra, that;s our problem

-> focus shifted from managing infra, to managing CODE insteAD!

-> Software as a Service -> made possible because of PaaS 

-> fortune 500, financial companies, insurance -> Azure 

------------------------------
GCP -> 2002-03 -> index the entire internet!!! 
[Advertising]-> Big Data 

- bots, spiders (crawlers) -> VERY fast pace 

-> ENDED up with data that couldn't be stored in 1 machine anymore

-> BIG DATA 
-> Google File System -> HDFS 
-> computing algorithm-> MAP-Reduce -> open source+mods => Apache Spark

-> SaaS -> SOlutions 
-> DatProc -> existing world was already on Apache SPark
-> GCP provided a LIFT and SHIFT model for IaaS
-> and BigQuery, bigTable, cloudSpanner, CLoudSQL -> db SaaS



-----------------
2020 -> all of them -> anybody who does something is 
immediately (little delay available everywhere else) 



Azure -> has left all the other clouds 50 years behind for AI/ML 
-> support for on-prem, AI/ML, gene sequencing


Azure is the only cloud-> AI/ML and IoT models and run them on-prem

Azure will treat your infra as if it were Azure itself!!
-> HYBRID CLOUD!!! 

Gene Sequencing -> DNA, RNA-> A,B,G... -> Palindromic Sequences 
AI/ML -> predict diseases and fixes, inc lifespan, travel in space
new food items, lab-grown cruelty free meat
